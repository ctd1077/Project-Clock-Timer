-Created countdown
-StartedTkinter UI



-Start with the UI just displaying the count down and project name

-Will need to run the main scrip in the background and the UI will just access the infomation


- Or a different aproach will be to set the end date in tkinter and access 
- the timer based off that original date entered.
- So that project and date will stay the same everytime you access the UI
